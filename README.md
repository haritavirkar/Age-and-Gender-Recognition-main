# Age-and-Gender-Recognition-main

This project aims to recognize the age and gender of individuals from images using deep learning techniques.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Age-and-Gender-Recognition-main.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the age and gender recognition model:

1. Prepare your images and place them in the `input_images` directory.

2. Run the following command:

```bash
python recognize_age_and_gender.py
```

This will process the images in the `input_images` directory and display the predicted age and gender for each individual.

## Model

The age and gender recognition model is based on a pre-trained deep neural network. The model has been trained on a large dataset of images containing faces with annotated age and gender labels.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. Sample results and performance metrics can be found in the `results` directory.
